                    <p>Steganography is described as the art of concealing a message in another. In this case, a string
                    is hidden within another string. Any innocent bystander will see the unconcealed string would not
                    take notice to the concealed message.</p>
                    <p>In cryptography, the observer is able clearly see that a message has been encrypted and this
                    gives raise to scrutiny. Whereas in steganography, the intended secret message is hidden from
                    outside observers, thus does not attract any unwanted attention.</p>
                    <p>However, the problem with steganography is that should anyone realize the presence of a secret
                    message they are able to access it easily. Hence, to truly secure the message and hide it from
                    observers we must apply both.</p>

                    <p>The secret message is encrypted using a password of your choice.</p>
                    <p>The password is used to seed the pseudo-random number generator. We obtain the key-stream
                    by continuously generating 32-bit integers and appending their bitstring to it until we have a
                    sufficient length. The binary representation of the secret message is encrypted by using the XOR
                    operation with the key-stream.</p>
                    <p>To decrypt the secret message, the receiver can perform the same XOR operation on their matching key-stream generated using
                    the password.</p>

                    <p>Zero-Width Characters also known as Invisible characters are non-printing characters in the
                    unicode table. As the name indicates they arent drawn in text.</p>
                    <p>The below table shows the unicode characters that we will be using.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>The encoded bitstring is converted to invisible characters by applying the above table.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre>01101000 01101001</pre>
                    <p>When encoded with the above table gives:</p>
                    <pre>BCCABCCB</pre>
                    <p>This is then placed in the first space or between the first and second character if there is no
                    space in the unconcealed string.</p>
                    <pre>Unconcealed <small>BCCABCCB</small>String</pre>
                    <p>The resulting string is sent as the message where the receiver with the key will decrypt and
                    read it.</p>
