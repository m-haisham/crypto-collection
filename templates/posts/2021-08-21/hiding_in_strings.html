    <p>Steganography is described as the art of concealing a message in another. In this case, a string
        is hidden within another string. Any innocent bystander will see the unconcealed string would
        not
        take notice to the concealed message.</p>
    <p>In cryptography, the observer is able clearly see that a message has been encrypted and this
        gives raise to scrutiny. Whereas in steganography, the intended secret message is hidden from
        outside observers, thus does not attract any unwanted attention.</p>
    <p>However, the problem with steganography is that should anyone realize the presence of a secret
        message they are able to access it easily. Hence, to truly secure the message and hide it from
        observers we must apply both.</p>

    <h5 class="my-3">Encrypting the secret message</h5>
    <p>The secret message is encrypted using a password of your choice.</p>
    <p>The password is used to seed the pseudo-random number generator. We obtain the key-stream
        by continuously generating 32-bit integers and appending their bitstring to it until we have a
        sufficient length. The binary representation of the secret message is encrypted by using the XOR
        operation with the key-stream.</p>
    <p>To decrypt the secret message, the receiver can perform the same XOR operation on their matching
        key-stream generated using
        the password.</p>

    <h5 class="my-3">Hiding the secret message in a plain string</h5>
    <p>Zero-Width Characters also known as Invisible characters are non-printing characters in the
        unicode table. As the name indicates they arent drawn in text.</p>
    <p>The below table shows the unicode characters that we will be using.</p>
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Bits</th>
            <th scope="col">Char</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>00</td>
            <td>200C (A)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>01</td>
            <td>200D (B)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>2060 (C)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>2062 (D)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The encoded bitstring is converted to invisible characters by applying the above table.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>01101000 01101001</pre>
    <p>When encoded with the above table gives:</p>
    <pre>BCCABCCB</pre>
    <p>This is then placed in the first space or between the first and second character if there is no
        space in the unconcealed string.</p>
    <pre>Unconcealed <small>BCCABCCB</small>String</pre>
    <p>The resulting string is sent as the message where the receiver with the key will decrypt and
        read it.</p>
