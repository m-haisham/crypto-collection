        A dictionary attack is a brute-force technique where the algorithm runs through a list of predefined
        words and phrases, such as those from a dictionary or previous data breaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where traditional brute-force attacks may try every possible combination, a dictionary attack uses
        a limited number of pre-selected words. As a dictionary attack doesnt go through every possible
        combination it reduces the likelihood that a difficult password may be guessed. On the other hand, this
        reduces the time and resources required to execute such an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
        A dictionary attack tried only those that are deemed most likely to succeed. Dictionary attacks often
        succeed because many people use short passwords or ordinary words.
